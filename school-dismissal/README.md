## Architecture Notes

### Backend Logic Priority
The application prioritizes robust backend logic for queue management, authorization, and event logging before focusing on UI polish. This ensures data integrity and proper workflow enforcement.

### Manual Queue Entry
Parents are manually logged into the queue by dismisser staff for security reasons, ensuring proper identity verification and maintaining controlled access to students.

### Event Logging
Every pickup event is logged with timestamps for auditing purposes, providing a complete timeline from queue entry to student dismissal.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time WebSocket updates for live queue status
- Mobile app for parents with push notifications
- Integration with school information systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard
- Automated parent notification system
- Support for multiple pickup methods (walking, bus, carline)
